# Story 1.1 Repo scaffold & dev scripts

As a developer,
I want a repository scaffold with server and web app folders, dev scripts, and a README,
so that I can run and iterate on the project locally.

Acceptance Criteria
1. A `/server` and `/web` folder exist with minimal starter files (server package manifest, web package manifest).
2. `README.md` includes quick start commands for installing deps and running the apps locally.
3. `scripts` in the root package.json (or simple shell scripts) provide `dev`, `start`, and `test` shortcuts.
