# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a monorepo with separate `frontend` and `backend` packages,
**so that** I can develop application components in an organized structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A root `package.json` configured with `npm` workspaces is present.
2. `frontend` and `backend` packages exist, each with its own `package.json`.
3. Core dependencies (React, Node, TypeScript, Vite, Express) are installed in the appropriate packages.
4. A basic "canary" page/endpoint can be run for both frontend and backend to verify the setup.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Initialize Monorepo Structure (AC: 1, 2)**
  - [x] Initialize an npm project in the root directory (`npm init -y`).
  - [x] Create `frontend` and `backend` directories.
  - [x] Configure the root `package.json` with a `workspaces` property pointing to `["frontend", "backend"]`.
- [x] **Task 2: Set up Backend Package (AC: 2, 3)**
  - [x] Initialize an npm project within the `backend` directory.
  - [x] Install backend dependencies: `express`, `pg`.
  - [x] Install backend dev dependencies: `@types/express`, `@types/pg`, `typescript`, `ts-node`, `nodemon`.
  - [x] Create a `tsconfig.json` for the backend.
- [x] **Task 3: Set up Frontend Package (AC: 2, 3)**
  - [x] Initialize a React + TypeScript project using Vite in the `frontend` directory.
  - [x] Install any additional frontend dependencies if needed.
- [x] **Task 4: Create Canary Verification Points (AC: 4)**
  - [x] In the backend, create a simple Express server with a `/api/health` endpoint that returns `200 OK`.
  - [x] In the frontend, modify the main App component to fetch data from the `/api/health` endpoint and display a success message.
- [x] **Task 5: Add Initial Test Setup**
  - [x] Add a basic unit test setup for the backend (e.g., using Jest or Vitest).
  - [x] Verify the default Vite test setup for the frontend runs correctly.

## Dev Notes
This story establishes the foundational structure of the project. All technical decisions must align with the architecture documents.

- **Monorepo Strategy:** The project will use `npm` workspaces to manage the `frontend` and `backend` packages within a single repository. This simplifies dependency management and local development. `[Source: docs/architecture/infrastructure-deployment.md#monorepo-strategy]`
- **Backend Technology:** The backend will be a Node.js application using the Express.js framework, written in TypeScript. Database interactions will use the `pg` library. `[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#tech-stack]`
- **Frontend Technology:** The frontend will be a React application, bootstrapped with Vite for a fast development environment, and written in TypeScript. `[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#tech-stack]`
- **Containerization:** While not implemented in this story, the structure should be created with Docker in mind. Each package (`frontend`, `backend`) will eventually have its own `Dockerfile`, and a `docker-compose.yml` file will be added at the root to orchestrate the local development environment. `[Source: docs/architecture/infrastructure-deployment.md#containerization]`

### Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Each package (`frontend`, `backend`) must include its own unit test suite. All new business logic and components should be accompanied by unit tests. `[Source: docs/architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md#testing-strategy]`
- **Integration Tests:** A separate integration test suite will be established later to test the full application stack. This is not part of the current story. `[Source: docs/architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md#testing-strategy]`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The initial implementation met the functional requirements for scaffolding. However, the test quality was low. The backend test was a placeholder, and the frontend test was incomplete and produced warnings. I have refactored both tests to be meaningful and robust.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `backend/src/index.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Replaced placeholder test with an actual API test using `supertest`.
  - **Why**: The original test (`1+1=2`) provided no value. The new test validates the actual `/api/health` endpoint.
  - **How**: It makes a real request to the endpoint and asserts the HTTP status code, verifying the canary endpoint is working.

- **File**: `frontend/src/App.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced the basic render test with two tests that mock `fetch` and verify the UI's reaction to both healthy and unhealthy backend states.
  - **Why**: The original test only checked for a static title and produced an `act(...)` warning. The new tests validate the asynchronous logic, which is the core functionality of the canary.
  - **How**: By mocking the `fetch` call and using `findByText`, the tests correctly wait for the UI to update, resolving the warning and properly testing the component's behavior.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✗] Initial tests did not meet the strategy. Now they do. [✓]
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored backend test to validate the API endpoint.
- [x] Refactored frontend test to handle async operations and validate UI updates.

### Security Review

No security concerns found.

### Performance Considerations

No performance concerns found.

### Files Modified During Review

- `backend/src/index.test.ts`
- `frontend/src/App.test.tsx`
- `backend/package.json` (added supertest)
