# Story 2.5 Infra: deployment scripts & config

As a devops engineer,
I want documented deployment steps and configuration (env examples, migration commands),
so that CI/CD can deploy services reliably.

Acceptance Criteria
1. `deploy/` contains example config files and a `README-deploy.md` with steps.
2. Environment variable list is documented (`DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `WS_JWT_SECRET`, etc.).
