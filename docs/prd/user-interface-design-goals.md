# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The application's user experience should be sophisticated, clean, and visually appealing, drawing inspiration from the modern, uncluttered aesthetics of platforms like Airbnb. The goal is to create a premium, intuitive interface that feels both powerful and effortless to use, making task management a pleasant experience.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Users will primarily manage task order through a fluid drag-and-drop interface.
- **In-line Editing:** Clicking on a task should allow for seamless in-place editing of its content.
- **Real-time Filtering:** The task list should update instantly as the user types in the search/filter bar.

## Core Screens and Views
- **Login/Sign-Up Screen:** A clean, simple entry point for user authentication.
- **Main Dashboard / Todo List:** The central view where users see, manage, and interact with their tasks. This is the primary workspace.
- **User Settings Page:** A basic screen for managing account details (e.g., changing password).

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application should adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding
The visual design should follow a minimalist and modern aesthetic. While no formal style guide exists, the look and feel should be comparable to high-quality, design-focused web applications.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application must be a responsive web app, providing a seamless and fully functional experience across all major modern desktop and mobile web browsers.
