# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
To create a user interface that is not just functional but also delightful, engaging, and motivating. The experience should feel less like a productivity tool and more like a rewarding game, encouraging daily use and habit formation. The UI will be a core differentiator, transforming mundane tasks into satisfying accomplishments.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
The user experience will be built on a foundation of direct manipulation and satisfying feedback. Key paradigms will include:
* **Drag-and-Drop**: For intuitive reordering and moving tasks between states on the Kanban board.
* **Rewarding Feedback**: Animations, sound effects, and visual flourishes upon task completion to create a sense of achievement.
* **Visible Progression**: Clear and persistent display of points, streaks, or other gamified metrics to motivate the user.

## Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the MVP will require the following core screens:
* Login / Sign Up Screen
* Main Dashboard (featuring the Kanban Board view)
* Task Creation / Editing Modal (or a dedicated page)
* User Profile / Score Page

## Accessibility
The application will aim for compliance with **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards to ensure it is accessible and usable by the widest possible audience.

## Branding
The branding identity should feel modern, vibrant, and encouraging. It must avoid the sterile, corporate aesthetic common in other productivity apps. The specific color palette, typography, and logo are to be defined, but the overall tone should be playful yet focused.

## Target Device and Platforms
The application will be built as a **Web Responsive** product. It will be designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure a seamless and fully-functional experience across all modern devices, from smartphones to desktop computers.
