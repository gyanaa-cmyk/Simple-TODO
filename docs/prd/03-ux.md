 # User Experience

 ## Design Philosophy
- Human feel, tactile feedback, warm gradients.
- Predictable delight and progressive complexity.

## Information Architecture
- Dashboard: Today’s tasks (Animated card stack)
- Lists: Manage personal/shared (Slide-in glass cards)
- Task Modal: Add/Edit tasks (FAB morph animation)
- Shared View: Teams & presence (Reactions + confetti)
- Profile: Stats, streaks (Parallax charts)

## Interaction Patterns
- FAB morph transitions.
- Confetti completion bursts.
- Swipe gestures for actions.
- Realtime reaction feedback.
- Mobile gestures + web rail navigation.

## Accessibility & Performance
- WCAG AA color contrast.
- Motion preferences respected.
- Load ≤1.5s, 60fps animations.
