# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure
* A **Monorepo** will be used to keep the frontend and backend code organized in a single repository.

## Service Architecture
* The backend will be developed as a single, **Monolithic Server Application**.

## Testing Requirements
* The project will require **Unit + Integration** tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* **Frontend**: React
* **Backend**: Node.js with Express
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Containerization**: The application must be containerized with Docker for development (Docker Compose) and production.
* **Hosting**: The target deployment infrastructure is Kubernetes (K8s).
* **API**: A REST API will be used for communication between the frontend and backend.
