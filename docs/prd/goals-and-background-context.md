# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Achieve a high Net Promoter Score (NPS) or equivalent user satisfaction rating (e.g., 4.5+ star average).
*   Validate the one-time purchase pricing model by achieving a target number of sales.
*   Position the project as a leading alternative to subscription-based todo applications.
*   Achieve a high user retention rate, with users actively managing tasks for at least three months.
*   Realize a high conversion rate from trial users to paid customers.

## Background Context

Individuals and professionals often struggle with personal organization, caught between overly simplistic free apps and expensive, feature-bloated subscription services. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a full-stack, multi-user todo list application that offers a premium, "prosumer-grade" experience without a recurring subscription. The core value is to provide a beautiful, modern, and feature-rich task management tool that users can purchase outright, filling a significant gap in the current market.
