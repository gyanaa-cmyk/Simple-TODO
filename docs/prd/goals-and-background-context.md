# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* To create a to-do list application that increases user motivation and engagement through gamification.
* To build lasting organizational habits for users by making task management enjoyable and rewarding.
* To differentiate from a crowded market of purely functional productivity apps by focusing on a superior, interactive user experience.

## Background Context
The current market for to-do list applications fails to address user motivation, leading to high abandonment rates. Existing solutions are functional but uninspiring. We will solve this by building a gamified task management application specifically for our target audience of ambitious students. By incorporating an engaging UI and satisfying feedback loops, we will make productivity feel less like a chore and more like a rewarding game, driving higher user retention and success.
