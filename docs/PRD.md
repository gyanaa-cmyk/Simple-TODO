# FlowList — Product Requirements (Sharded Index)

This repository uses a sharded PRD to make collaboration easier. Use the links below to open each section.

- Overview: `prd/00-overview.md`
- Goals & Metrics: `prd/01-goals-metrics.md`
- Core Features: `prd/02-core-features.md`
- User Experience: `prd/03-ux.md`
- Technical Overview: `prd/04-technical.md`
- MVP Scope: `prd/05-mvp.md`

A full, unsharded backup of the original PRD is available at `docs/PRD-full.md`.

If you'd like different sharding (more/fewer files), tell me which sections to combine or split.
