# Project Brief: Simple Todo

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

This project will create a full-stack, multi-user todo list application designed for individuals and professionals seeking a modern, visually appealing, and feature-rich task management experience. The application will solve the problem of personal organization by providing a centralized, web-based platform for users to manage their tasks with features like due dates, drag-and-drop reordering, and text-based search. The primary value proposition is to offer a premium, user-friendly interface and a robust feature set that rivals subscription-based services, delivered as a premium, standalone application.

---

### **2. Problem Statement**

Individuals and professionals often struggle to maintain personal organization effectively. The available tools for task management typically fall into two unsatisfying categories: 1) overly simplistic, free applications that lack essential features and are quickly outgrown; or 2) powerful platforms that lock users into expensive, perpetual subscription models and suffer from feature bloat. This leaves a significant gap for a high-quality solution that can be acquired with a clear, single transaction. The core problem is the lack of a "prosumer-grade" task manager that offers a premium experience without the burden of a recurring subscription.

---

### **3. Proposed Solution**

We propose the development of a full-stack web application for personal task management, built on a modern, reliable technology stack (React/TypeScript, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL).

Its key differentiator is the combination of a sophisticated, visually-appealing user interface—inspired by clean, modern aesthetics like Airbnb's—with a robust feature set including multi-user authentication, drag-and-drop reordering, due dates, and text search. By providing a premium experience that users typically have to pay a subscription for, this solution will succeed by directly serving the market of users who want to buy quality software, not rent it. The vision is to create a best-in-class personal productivity tool.

### **4. Target Users**

**Primary User Segment: The Discerning Professional**

*   **Profile:** This user is a professional, creative, or student who values high-quality software and is willing to pay for a good user experience. They are organized, design-conscious, and increasingly wary of "subscription fatigue."
*   **Behaviors:** They currently use one or more subscription-based productivity tools but are frustrated by the recurring costs and the feeling of not owning their software. They appreciate well-crafted applications and are loyal to products that are simple, beautiful, and effective.
*   **Needs & Pain Points:** They need a powerful and reliable task manager but want to escape the endless cycle of monthly/annual fees. They are frustrated by the complexity of enterprise-focused tools and the lack of quality in many free alternatives.
*   **Goals:** Their primary goal is to find a "buy it for life" quality tool that helps them stay organized, looks beautiful on their desktop, and has a clear, transparent pricing model.

---

### **5. Goals & Success Metrics**

**Project Objectives**
*   **Product-Market Fit:** Achieve a high Net Promoter Score (NPS) or equivalent user satisfaction rating (e.g., 4.5+ star average) on product review platforms within the first six months.
*   **Commercial Viability:** Validate the pricing model by achieving a target number of sales in the first year.
*   **Establish as a Quality Leader:** Position the project as a leading alternative to subscription-based todo applications, measured by positive reviews in tech media and user forums.

**User Success Metrics**
*   **High Retention Rate:** A successful user is one who actively uses the application to manage their daily tasks for a period of at least three months.
*   **High Conversion Rate:** A significant percentage of trial users convert to paid customers, validating that the product delivers on its promises.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
*   **User Satisfaction (NPS/Reviews):** Measures how much users love the product.
*   **Sales/Downloads:** Measures commercial success and market adoption.
*   **Active User Base:** Measures long-term engagement and retention.

### **6. MVP Scope**

**Core Features (Must-Haves for MVP)**
*   **Secure User Authentication:** Users can create an account, log in, and log out.
*   **Full Todo Management (CRUD):** Authenticated users can create, view, edit, and delete their own tasks.
*   **Task State & Reordering:** Users can mark tasks as complete and can change the order of tasks via drag-and-drop.
*   **Due Dates & Search:** Users can add an optional due date to tasks and can filter their task list by searching for text content.
*   **Stable Application:** The application is delivered as a stable, reliable hosted service.

**Out of Scope for MVP**
*   Third-party application integrations (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack).
*   Advanced collaboration features (e.g., sharing todo lists, assigning tasks).
*   Native mobile or desktop clients.
*   Advanced features like sub-tasks, project boards, or file attachments.

**MVP Success Criteria**
The MVP will be deemed successful when a new user can sign up, pay for the service, and manage their tasks using all the core features listed above for one week without encountering critical bugs or data loss.

---

### **7. Post-MVP Vision**

**Phase 2 Features**
Once the MVP is stable and commercially validated, development will focus on the most requested features, likely including:
*   **Collaboration:** Introduce features for small teams, such as sharing lists and assigning tasks.
*   **Integrations:** Add support for popular third-party integrations like Google Calendar.
*   **Native Clients:** Develop native or installable desktop and mobile applications as a premium offering.

**Long-term Vision (1-2 Years)**
The long-term vision is to expand from a single application into a focused suite of privacy-respecting, non-subscription productivity tools, potentially including a notes application and a calendar. The brand will be synonymous with high-quality, user-funded software that rejects the subscription model.

**Expansion Opportunities**
*   **Tiered Pricing:** Introduce pricing tiers for "Pro" and "Team" versions with advanced features.
*   **API for Third-Party Devs:** Create a public API to allow other developers to build integrations, fostering an ecosystem.

### **8. Technical Considerations**

**Platform & Performance Requirements**
*   **Target Platforms:** The web application must be fully functional and performant on the latest versions of all major modern browsers.
*   **Performance:** The user interface should feel responsive and fluid, with interactions completing in under 100ms.

**Technology Preferences**
*   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, built with Vite. Styling by Tailwind CSS, animations by Framer Motion.
*   **Backend:** A Node.js server running Express, written in TypeScript.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (version 16).
*   **Hosting:** The application will be hosted on a major cloud provider like AWS or GCP, using scalable infrastructure.

**Architecture Considerations**
*   **Repository Structure:** A monorepo managed with `npm` workspaces.
*   **Service Architecture:** A standard decoupled SPA + REST API architecture, designed for scalability and maintainability.
*   **Security:** API endpoints protected via JWT. Passwords will be securely hashed. All standard web security best practices will be followed.

### **9. Constraints & Assumptions**

**Constraints**
*   **Budget:** The project has a defined seed budget for initial development and hosting, but must become self-sustaining through sales.
*   **Timeline:** There is a target launch window of 3-6 months to capitalize on market interest.
*   **Resources:** The project relies on a small, focused development team.

**Key Assumptions**
*   **Willingness to Pay:** We assume there is a market segment willing to pay a one-time fee for a high-quality application, rejecting the subscription model.
*   **Value Proposition:** We assume that a superior UI/UX and a clear pricing model are strong enough differentiators in a crowded market.
*   **Marketing Reach:** We assume we can effectively reach our target audience of "Discerning Professionals" through targeted online marketing.

### **10. Risks & Open Questions**

**Key Risks**
*   **Market Saturation:** The productivity space is extremely competitive. The product may fail to gain visibility or traction against established giants.
*   **Pricing Model Failure:** The one-time purchase model may not be financially sustainable compared to the recurring revenue of subscriptions.
*   **Customer Acquisition Cost:** The cost of reaching and converting customers may be too high to be profitable.
*   **"Good Enough" Competition:** Users may decide that existing free or bundled tools are "good enough," and the value proposition isn't strong enough to warrant a purchase.

**Open Questions**
*   What is the optimal price point for the application?
*   What are the most effective marketing channels to reach our target user?
*   What is the "killer feature" that will be the primary driver of purchases?
*   How will ongoing updates and maintenance be funded under a one-time purchase model?

**Areas Needing Further Research**
*   **Competitor Pricing Analysis:** A deep dive into the pricing strategies of competitors, both subscription and single-purchase.
*   **Market Segmentation:** Research to better quantify the size and characteristics of the anti-subscription market segment.
