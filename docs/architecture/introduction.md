# Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture for the Simple Todo application. It covers the frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure design, ensuring a cohesive, scalable, and maintainable system. This architecture is derived from the project's Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the UI/UX Specification, translating functional and non-functional requirements into a technical blueprint.

## Guiding Principles
- **Decoupled Services:** A clear separation between the frontend Single-Page Application (SPA) and the backend REST API to promote independent development and deployment.
- **Pragmatic Technology:** Utilizing a modern but stable and well-supported tech stack (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL) to ensure developer productivity and system reliability.
- **User-Centric Design:** The architecture is designed to support the fluid, responsive, and performant user experience defined in the UI/UX specification.
- **Container-First:** Standardizing on Docker for all environments to ensure consistency from local development to production.
