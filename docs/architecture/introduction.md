# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Gamified To-Do List application, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for all technical decisions, guiding the development agents.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

  * **Decision**: The project will be built from scratch with a **manual monorepo setup**.
  * **Rationale**: Per the user's request for a small project, a dedicated monorepo tool like Nx or Turborepo will not be used. Custom scripts will be required for managing workspaces and running tasks.
