# Security and Performance

## **Security Requirements**

  * **Frontend Security**:
      * **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: A strict CSP will be implemented to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
      * **XSS Prevention**: We will rely on React's native data binding to automatically sanitize content rendered in the UI.
      * **Secure Storage**: Authentication tokens (JWTs) will be stored in secure, `HttpOnly` cookies to prevent them from being accessed by client-side scripts.
  * **Backend Security**:
      * **Input Validation**: All incoming data from users (request bodies, params, queries) will be strictly validated on the backend using a library like `zod`.
      * **Rate Limiting**: The API will have rate limiting enabled to prevent brute-force and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
      * **CORS Policy**: The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy will be configured to only allow requests from our known frontend domain.
  * **Authentication Security**:
      * **Password Policy**: Passwords will be hashed using a strong, salted algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
      * **Session Management**: We will use stateless JWTs with a short expiration time for user sessions.

## **Performance Optimization**

  * **Frontend Performance**:
      * **Bundle Size Target**: The initial JavaScript bundle for the main page should be under 500KB (gzipped).
      * **Loading Strategy**: We will use route-based code-splitting and lazy-load components where appropriate.
      * **Caching Strategy**: Static assets will be configured for aggressive browser caching.
  * **Backend Performance**:
      * **Response Time Target**: The 95th percentile (p95) response time for all core API endpoints should be under 200ms.
      * **Database Optimization**: We will leverage the database indexes defined in our schema and use connection pooling.
      * **Caching Strategy**: Post-MVP, a caching layer (e.g., Redis) can be introduced for frequently accessed, non-critical data.
