# Infrastructure & Deployment

## Monorepo Strategy
- **Tool:** `npm` workspaces will be used to manage the `frontend` and `backend` packages within a single repository.
- **Benefit:** Simplifies dependency management and cross-package development.

## Containerization
- **Tool:** Docker.
- **Files:**
    - A `Dockerfile` will be created for both the `frontend` and `backend` services to build production-ready container images.
    - A `docker-compose.yml` file will orchestrate the local development environment, including the frontend, backend, and postgres services.

## Local Environment
- **Orchestration:** `docker-compose up` will be the single command needed to start the entire application stack locally.

## Production Environment
- **Hosting:** The application will be deployed to a self-hosted Kubernetes (K8s) cluster.
- **Process:**
    1. On merge to the main branch, a CI/CD pipeline will build Docker images.
    2. Images will be pushed to a private container registry.
    3. Kubernetes deployment manifests will be applied to the cluster to roll out the new version of the application.
