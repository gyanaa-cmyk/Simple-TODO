# Deployment Architecture

## **Deployment Strategy**

  * **Frontend Deployment**: Static React assets will be served from a lightweight **Nginx** container running within our Kubernetes cluster.
  * **Backend Deployment**: The Node.js/Express API will run as a **Node.js** container within our Kubernetes cluster.

## **CI/CD Pipeline (Example: GitHub Actions)**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  test-and-build:
    name: Test and Build Images
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
      - name: Install Dependencies & Run Tests
      - name: Build and Push Docker Images
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to Kubernetes
    needs: test-and-build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
      - name: Configure Kubernetes Credentials
      - name: Deploy Application using Helm
```

## **Environments**

| Environment | Frontend URL | Backend URL | Purpose |
